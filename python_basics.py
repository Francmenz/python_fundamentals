# python programming fundamentals

# how to print hello world on the terminal
print("Hello world!")

# show your name on the terminal
print("my name is Franc Menz!")

# VARIABLES
# variables are just a container for storing data 
# example
name = "Franc"
# "name" is the variable of which the data "franc" has been saved.. so where ever we want to access the data called "franc", we can call the variable "name"

# example
print(name)
# this will show "franc" on the terminal

# let's make it more interesting
# we want to greet "franc"
print("Hello!!.. Good afternoon ", name)
# this one will just access the container "name" and fetch the data in that container "name", so that's "franc" then greet him.....

# another variable
age = 20
# so variable "age" stores a numerical data "20"
print("Hello",name, " you are ", age,"years old.")
